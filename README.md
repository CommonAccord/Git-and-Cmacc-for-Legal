# Git-and-Cmacc-for-Legal

1. Introduction:

  1.  Need for collaborative publishing for legal is very strong
  
    * Same iterative improvements as for software (many eye balls, experience, etc.)
    
    * Plus: legal is non-deterministic - re-use is how we increase predictability
  
  1.   Weaknesses of alternative publishing methods
  
    *  Word processing ping-pong; document assembly; standards bodies; legislation

  1.   Fit with smart contracts, with P2P (identity), with blockchains, with IoT, and with legal codification

  1. Governance goals 

   1. No liability.  Review carefully the source of information (git preserves provenance), motivations and competence of authors, etc.

1. Publishing Legal on Github:

  1. Posting a document or other material.

  1. Improving existing materials:

     1. extensions by Cmacc links 

     1. git-based forking, merging, pull requests, 

     1. Reuse: copyright, respect, moral rights
     
1. Using Cmacc materials

  *  Copy a document or text and paste into your own document.
  
  *  Create a term sheet and reference a document by URL.  But also note the "commit" number (from GitHub) so that there will be certainty about the version.
  
  *  Make an instance - see the next item.
  
    * Clone the materials into your instance, and/or
    
    * Use URL links to materials hosted on GitHub or elsewhere using the =[?http://raw.github.com... ] convention ( see, e.g. http://source.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=source&file=S/Sandbox/Form/Form-Agt-FR-Demo.md)

1. Running a Cmacc instance
