# Git-and-Cmacc-for-Legal

1. Introduction:

  1.  Need for collaborative publishing for legal is very strong
  
    * Same iterative improvements as for software (many eye balls, experience, etc.)
    
    * Plus: legal is non-deterministic - re-use is how we increase predictability
  
  1.   Weaknesses of alternative publishing methods
  
    *  Word processing ping-pong; document assembly; standards bodies; legislation

  1.   Fit with smart contracts, with P2P (identity), with blockchains, with IoT, and with legal codification

  1. Governance goals 

   1. No liability.  Review carefully the source of information (git preserves provenance), motivations and competence of authors, etc.

1. Publishing Legal on Github:

  1. Posting a document or other material.

  1. Improving existing materials:

     1. git-based forking merging, pull requests, 

     1. extensions by linking 

     1. Reuse: copyright, respect, moral rights
     
1. Using Cmacc materials

  *  Copy a document or text and paste into your own document.
  
  *  Create a term sheet and reference a document on one of our sites by URL.  But also note the "commit" number (on GitHub) so that there will be certainty about the version.
  
  *  Run an instance - see the next item.

1. Running a Cmacc instance

  1. Cloning an instance of Primavera's code. https://github.com/commonaccord/cmacc-app

  1.  Adding the document objects that you want, e.g.:
  
    * https://github.com/commonaccord/Agt-NDA

    * https://github.com/commonaccord/YC-SAFE


  1. Installing locally
